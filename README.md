# Parking Space Indicator

My idea is to build a sensor that will indicate if the parking spot in my garage is available or not. 

## Summary

In my building there are 4 cars and only one garage parking spot. Nobody in the building has a remote garage door opener. Every day when I come home from work or school I am required to hop out of my car, input the garage key code, and check to see if the space in the garage is available, usually to find that it is not. I want to take the skills which I have developed in programing and electronics to build a device that will make life a little bit easier for everyone living in my building. Now that the summer months are arriving it has become harder and harder to find parking in my beachside neighborhood. The project will consist of a sensor that will be mounted on the ceiling of my garage. The sensor will be connected to a red LED light propped up against the frosted window that will activate when there is a car in the parking spot.

## Challenges

I think it will be hard to build a device that can work around the garage door opening and shutting. I hope that by mounting the distance sensor on the ceiling I will be able to have the light turn on every time an object is within ~4 feet of it. I believe the ceiling is 12 feet from the ground. 

Some problems I came across while building my board include purchasing an incompatible sensor, the garage being use and purchasing the wrong resistors. 

## How I Did It

To complete this task I chose to hang the sensor from the ceiling of my garage. The sensor looks downwards towards the parked car. If the truck is parked in the garage the distance is further and I can program the sensor to trigger the light at a further distance indicating which car is parked in the garage. 

## What I Learned 

Throughout this process I learned that I am capable of programing my own electronic devices. This project has made me perceive the objects I use on a daily basis in a new light. I now better understand the underlying components to how my devices work.

## What to do diferently next time

Next time I will be sure to purchase parts that I am positive are compatible with my hardware. I will also be sure to reserve the space that I need in order to actually test the device in its intended environment.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Research / order parts
- Week 3: Construction
- Week 4: Construction
- Week 5: Present!
