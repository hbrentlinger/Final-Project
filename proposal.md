# Parking Space Indicator

My idea is to build a sensor that will indicate if the parking spot in my garage is available or not. 

## Summary

In my building there are 4 cars and only one garage parking spot. Nobody in the building has a remote garage door opener. Every day when I come home from work or school I am required to hop out of my car, input the garage key code, and check to see if the space in the garage is available, usually to find that it is not. I want to take the skills which I have developed in programing and electronics to build a device that will make life a little bit easier for everyone living in my building. Now that the summer months are arriving it has become harder and harder to find parking in my beachside neighborhood. The project will consist of a sensor that will be mounted on the ceiling of my garage. The sensor will be connected to a red LED light propped up against the frosted window that will activate when there is a car in the parking spot.

## Challenges

I think it will be hard to build a device that can work around the garage door opening and shutting. I hope that by mounting the distance sensor on the ceiling I will be able to have the light turn on every time an object is within ~4 feet of it. I believe the ceiling is 12 feet from the ground. 

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Research / order parts
- Week 3: Construction
- Week 4: Construction
- Week 5: Present!
